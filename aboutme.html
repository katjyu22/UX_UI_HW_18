                My name is Katherine but you can call me Kathy.
                I am currently an aspiring UX/UI designer who is interested in design-centered problem solving.
                <br>
                <br>
                I received my B.A. in psychology from UCR. Although I enjoyed learning about the human mind, I
                wanted to pursue a more creative avenue. After I graduated I took some graphic design classes at my
                local community college. Wanting to pursue design more seriously, my instructor recommended I look
                into UX/UI and that brought me to where I am today.
                <br>
                <br>
                I love to be creative whether that is illustrating or solving problems. I feel encouraged to grow in
                an environment of authenticity and being challenged creatively.
